# Project Feed Reader Testing

This is my attempt at solving the 5th project in Udacity's Front-End Development Nanodegree. I've worked on completing the test suites in the `feedreader.js` file. Now all required tests are performed and pass.

## How to run

Clone the repository by pasting the following line of code into the git bash console:

`git clone https://github.com/n00b1209/feedreader-testing.git`

Next, open the `index.html` file in your browser. The app should start running right away as the Jasmine framework is already implemented.

Happy testing!
